# Extract Reasonable Developer Time Records from a GIT Repository's Commit Log
#
# This is inspired by a RAKE task publicly posted by Sharad at
# http://www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/.
# However, it has been adapted to run without Rails from the command line.

  # (1) A series of commits within a 3 hour window are part of the same development session
  # (2) A single commit (or the first commit of the session) is considered to represent 30 minutes of work time
  # (3) The more frequent a developer commits to the repository while working, the more accurate the time report will be
